Hi, this is Desheng. I am currently a research associate in the Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Department at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov/world/). I received my Ph.D. in applied physics from [Cornell University](https://www.duffield.cornell.edu/aep/).

My research focuses on developing new imaging methods in advanced electron microscopy, including 4D-STEM and ptychography; understanding nano- to atomic-scale phenomena in low-dimensional and quantum materials, as well as machine learning for physical science. 

**Primary research interests**: \\
4D-STEM and ptychography;
TEM/STEM methodology/instrumentation;
Low-dimensional and quantum materials; 
Machine learning and Bayesian statistics

If you are interested in my research or have any questions, please feel free to contact me at: [dma1@bnl.gov](mailto:dma1@bnl.gov) or [dm852@cornell.edu](mailto:dm852@cornell.edu).
