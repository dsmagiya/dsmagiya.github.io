I used to be a **vocalist in a band**, where we performed live music shows with more than **400 people** in the audience. Music has always been a creative outlet for me and helps balance the analytical side of my research work.

### 🎮 Gaming & Competition
I achieved **3rd place in the Intel Cup of CSGO in China** - demonstrating my competitive spirit and strategic thinking abilities that extend beyond academics. -->
