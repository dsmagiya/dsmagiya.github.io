  abstract = {Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Tilt-corrected imaging methods in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) have recently emerged as a new class of direct ptychography methods that are especially useful at low dose. The operation of tilt correction unfolds the contrast transfer functions (CTF) of the virtual bright-field images and retains coherence by correcting defocus-induced spatial shifts. By performing summation or subtraction of the tilt-corrected images, the real or imaginary parts of the complex phase-contrast transfer functions are recovered, producing a tilt-corrected bright field image (tcBF) or a differential phase contrast image (tcDPC). However, the CTF can be strongly damped by the introduction of higher-order aberrations than defocus. In this paper, we show how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which combines tcBF and tcDPC, enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF CTF. We demonstrate acBF on both simulated and experimental data, showing it produces superior performance to tcBF or DPC methods alone, and discuss its limitations.},

  abstract = {Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manual tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD (Ptychographic Reconstruction with Automatic Differentiation), an open-source software framework that offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters---such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes---using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation. By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 24\texttimes{} speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.},

  abstract = {Precise alignment of the electron beam is critical for successful application of scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) to understanding materials at atomic level. Despite the success of aberration correctors, aberration correction is still a complex process. Here we approach aberration correction from the perspective of accelerator physics and show it is equivalent to minimizing the emittance growth of the beam, the span of the phase space distribution of the probe. We train a deep learning model to predict emittance growth from experimentally accessible Ronchigrams. Both simulation and experimental results show the model can capture the emittance variation with aberration coefficients accurately. We further demonstrate the model can act as a fast-executing function for the global optimization of the lens parameters. Our approach enables new ways to quickly quantify and automate aberration correction that takes advantage of the rapid measurements possible with high-speed electron cameras. In part II of the paper, we demonstrate how the emittance metric enables rapid online tuning of the aberration corrector using Bayesian optimization.},

  abstract = {Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-\AA ngstr\"om probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.},
